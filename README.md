This project showcases a basic bank management system where users can:

- Register and log in to their accounts.
- Debit or credit their expenses.
- Transfer money to other accounts.
- View their total expenses.

The system uses Java for its core functionalities and integrates with an SQL database to store and update account data. Exception handling is incorporated to ensure smooth and interactive user experiences. This project serves as a foundational example of combining Java with SQL for practical banking applications.
